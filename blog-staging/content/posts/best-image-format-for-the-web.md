JPEG
---

JPEG is a widely used image format. One of its strengths is its compatibility. Pretty everything can use JPEG. 

There are many tools that allow you to compress JPEG files, one of those tools is ImageResizer.online. It makes resizing images easy on the web with no need to upload files to a server so it is secure and very fast. 

### Pros:
- small file size
- able to easily change the quality to what is needed
- suitable for color
- high quality images if quality is set to high
- very portable, supported by almost everything that can display pictures
- compatibility with almost every image processing software

### Cons:
- high compression can lead to the image becoming blocky due to the way jpeg is compressed
- Every step of compression degrades the file
- Does not support transparency
- JPEG compression algorithm is a lossy compression format
- JPEG only supports 8bit images

You can use <a href="https://imageresizer.online" target="_blank">ImageResizer.online</a> here.

PNG

PNG is a widely used format too. It is not as widely used as JPEG. It has good compatibility but some things are not able to work with PNG's fully. 

ImageResizer.online works well with PNG's the only issue is that you are not able to set an output quality. In order for you to do that you would need to use another tool like TinyPNY which you can find here.

### Pros:
- PNG allows transparency in images
- Lossless compression
- Has the ability to work with layers
- Relatively small file sizes
- Can support up to 24bit color

### Cons:
- Does not support animation
- Lossless compression - Cannot be compressed as much as JPEG

WebP
---

WebP is quite restricted. Only available on Chrome and Opera, there might be new browsers now but it is not widely supported. 

It has better lossless compress compared to PNG and better lossy compression compared to JPEG. <a href="https://imageresizer.online" target="_blank">ImageResizer.online</a> can work with WebP so long as you are using Chrome browser. 

With ImageResizer.online you can resize and change the quality of the image but again this can only be done on Chrome browser.

### Pros:
- WebP can be smaller than JPEG
- Can be higher quality when compressing compared to other formats
- Powerful format. Could replace other formats with regards to the web

### Cons:
- Only supported in Chrome and Opera browsers
- Not supported natively in operating systems

Conclusion
---
To pick a best one is pretty simple. For everyday images, JPEG makes the most sense whether you are using it online or just storing it on your computer. 

If you need features like transparency then PNG is the best option. PNG allows for transparency which means that it the perfect image format for creating things like buttons or just images that do not need a background. 

To be honest I would am not able to recommend WebP for the simple fact that compatibility is an issue.

If you need to optimize and reduce the file size of your images be sure to use <a href="https://imageresizer.online" target="_blank">ImageResizer.online</a> if you want a fast and easy tool to use. ImageResizer.online will also allow you do reduce the size of multiple images at the same time with its batch image resizing feature!
